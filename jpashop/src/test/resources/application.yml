# This has priority over the file in main>resources>application.yml in test case.
# Use Memory Database when test case is running.

#h2 Database -memory mode
# memory DB still runs when you shutdown db (ctrl+c) in your shell.
#!!!!! Even better!!!!
# you even DON'T NEED db settings(line 8~20) because Spring boot runs memory mode if db settings don't exists.
# memory mode is valid when WAS(tomcat of Spring boot) is running.
